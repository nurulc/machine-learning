# RNN
## Recurrent neural network

The key adea befind an RNN is to process a sequence of events, unlike afeedforward network, for example a <abbr title="Convolutional neural network"CNN</abbr>, that maintains no information about past input;  a Recurrent neural network maintains a state that is passed along as it receives new input.

RNN/LSTM and variants are not a good match for hardware acceleration see [see this note](https://medium.com/@culurciello/computation-and-memory-bandwidth-in-deep-neural-networks-16cbac63ebd5)
