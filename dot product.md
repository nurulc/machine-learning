# Dot Product

An efficient way of comparing two vectors

If __A__ and __B__ are two vectors (and are scaled to unit length) then


__||A||__ = 1 _and_ 
__||A||__ = 1

_A . B_  is 1 if the vectors are identical and 0 is the are perpendicular to rach other

It is a very efficient way to compare the similarity between two vectors
