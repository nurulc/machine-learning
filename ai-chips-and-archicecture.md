### Some observations of AI and edge computing

Recently ther is a major transformation happening in the developemnt of AI. for the last few years most advances in AI 
has been centerd around machine learning based on neural networks. The architectures and toolkits to support these efforts has been
almost completely centered around high perfore computing and GPU and AI chips based in large data centers. 

* History suggests that AI is going to move to the edge
* AI chips for edge computing is coming
* Neural networks (NN) based in gradient descent ar good at fine tuning the wieghts for a given NN, but not for the 
best architecture or hyper parameters for a given architecture.
* Genetic Algorithms (GA) are an alternative to neural networks
* Genetic Algorithms a good at exploring large search spaces but are poor at converging to an optimal solution
