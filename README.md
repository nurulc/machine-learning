## Notes on machine learning and linear algebra

This site is for mostly my personal notes  for storing interesting documents and links related to machine learning. Please feel free to contribute to this site.

### Glossary of machine learning terms

[Machine Learning Glossary](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/)
[10 Machine Learning terms explained](http://blog.aylien.com/10-machine-learning-terms-explained-in-simple/)

Some of the terms I found useful to take note of
* Algorithms: Naive Bayes, Decission Tree, SVM (Support Vector Machine), Neural Networks
* Classifier
* Regression
* Supervised learning - 
* Accuracy - percent of correct predictions from all the input
    * Precission - percent of prediction of a category that was correct, i.e. how useful is the result. For example, of all the cats predicted what percent was correct
    * Recall - percent of of a category was correctly predicted, i.e. how complete was result. For example, of all the cats in the data which percent was correct predicted * Blog by Christopher Olah
## Neural Network Architectures

* CNN - Convolutional Neural Network
* RNN - Recurrent Neural Network <br><img width="300" src="images/RNN-unrolled.png">
* [LSTM](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) - Long Short Term Memory
### Gradient Descent

* SGD - stocastic gradinet descent
* ADAM - efficient gradient descent optimizer
* Blog by [Christopher Olah](https://colah.github.io/)

## ROC

* Receiver operating characteristic

### Free Energy Principle

* What is it
* How do we use it
* What is the mathematical formulation
* Bayesian models 

### Capsule Network
* Hinton et al

* Why is it interesting?
* Key ideas in convolutional networks
* Alternative to max pooling
* Preserving key invariance
