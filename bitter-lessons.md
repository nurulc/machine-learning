# A very interesting of deep learning


[Bitter Lessons Rich Sutton](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html)

## Summary

The key summary of the note about machine learning is _general methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin._ Using you intution and fine tuning only gives short term benefits and you hit a brick wall and no further improvements can be gained. Over the long run as machines get faster and general methods that a computionally more expensive wins out.

> One thing that should be learned from the bitter lesson is the great power of general purpose methods, of methods that continue to scale with increased computation even as the available computation becomes very great. The two methods that seem to scale arbitrarily in this way are search and learning.
